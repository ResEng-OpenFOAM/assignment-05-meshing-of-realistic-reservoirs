# Meshing of Realistic Reservoirs

- Groups have 2-3 members

Here is a checklist to assist you in completing the project:

- [ ] Decide on a case to mesh.
- [ ] Decide on a tool (or a toolset) to use.
- [ ] Get a surface file for your chosen geometry (Preferably in STL format).
- [ ] Check the surface quality.
- [ ] Decide on how fine the mesh should be.
- [ ] Experiment with some meshing settings to produce a fine mesh.
- [ ] Check your mesh quality.
- [ ] Repeat until satisfied with the quality of the mesh.
- [ ] Produce a coarser version of the mesh to test things on.

> Open issues and pull-requests in this repository to discuss things with your teammates, 
> create branches to test things individually and then merge to `master`

> Also, don't delete this Readme file, modify it to describe your work instead!
